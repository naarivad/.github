# naarivad.in

a youth-led organisation focussing on the upliftment of women and gender 
minorities in policy, society, and media.

## Why this page?

As far as possible, we try to make all our public facing tools and the 
libraries that interact with them source-available, except when they're in early
stages of development and look ugly.
