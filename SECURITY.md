# Security policy

## Supported versions

As a general rule of thumb, we consider only the latest tag to be supported.
Some of our projects do not follow semantic versioning, and in such cases, only
the very latest commit is supported.
We combine this with our fast response to incidents, so risk is minimised.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability. email the maintainers directly at:

- Varun: root [at] varunj.me

**Do not open an issue or pull request directly**, because it might reveal the vulnerability.
